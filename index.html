            <h2 id="js">What is JavaScript?</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript 'thinks' in terms of "things/objects" in JS they are called Objects.</li>
                    <li>This DOM or Document Object Model is the basic foundation of the entire 
                        JavaScript language. </li>
                    <li>Objects contain objects: a pc has a browser which 
                        has a webpage which has a document.</li>
                    <li>Objects have properties: a webpage (Object) has a background (Object) 
                        color (Property), the color is a property.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript causes Actions to happen on or with Objects: These actions are called Methods.</li>
                    <li>Methods can be referred to as Functions.</li>
                    <li>Functions are Methods that you create/setup to perform a Task.</li>
                    <li>Events: Normally user action like moving mouse/clicking </li>
                    <li>Event Handlers: Actions to take when an Event occurs, which calls JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2 id="event">Events/Event Handlers</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Events are often users visiting/mouse moving/clicks which cause the Event Handler to react.</li>
                    <li>Event Listener: The mechanism for detecting events and triggering a response.</li>
                    <li>Event Handler: The function or code that is executed in response to the event.</li>
                    <li>An example would be a user clicks on a link (Event) and the Event Handler takes you to the specified link.</li>
                    <li>Event Handlers use variables and methods to perform the tasks they've been told to do.</li>
                    <li onMouseOver = "makeGreen()" onMouseOut="makeYellow()">
                        <!--Event: Mouse Movement | Events Listeners: MouseOver & MouseOut | Event Handlers: makeGreen() & makeYellow() -->
                        <a href="#" onMouseOver = "makeGreen()" onMouseOut="makeYellow()">
                            Move Mouse Over To Cause Event. HTML has the Event Listener. JS function is the Event Handler. 
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Event: Mouse Movement | Events Listeners: onMouseOver & onMouseOut | Event Handlers: makeGreen() & makeYellow()</li>
                    <code>
                        // This is the event handler function <br>
                        function handleClick() {<br>
                            console.log('The element was clicked!');<br>
                        }<br>
                        <br>
                        // Adding the event listener to an element<br>
                        document.getElementById('myElement').addEventListener('click', handleClick);
                    </code>
                    <li>Objects can be presented as either methods 'document.getElementById()' or properties 'document.URL' with dots between. </li>
                    <li>Events are not always user dependant, for example the 'onLoad' Event Handler </li>
                    <button id="js-button">Click to Make Green! (onClick)</button>
                    <li>Additional Event Listeners: onBlur, onFocus, onSelect, & onChange mainly used with HTML forms </li>
                    <button id="light-mode">Color Swap! (onClick + forEach)</button>

            <h2 id="event">Variables & Arrays</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Variables are Numbers, Letters, & Words which are used to connect to the value assigned to it.</li>
                    <li>Defining a Variables requires only a name/numbers and a value.</li>
                    <code>var numberEx = 1; | let stringEx = "JavaScript String"; | const booleanEx = true;</code>
                    <li>'numberEX', 'stringEX', and 'booleanEx' are variable names. 1, "JavaScript String", and True are values.</li>
                    <li>Variables have a naming convention called Camel Case: firstLeterSmallFollowingWordsBig</li>
                    <li>Variables allow can't do much along. So lets create and delcare some variables and add JavaScript!</li>
                    <code>
                        let day = 1;<br>
                        let text = "day"<br>
                        let x = "or"<br>
                        document.getElementById('variables').addEventListener('click', printString = () => {<br>
                            document.getElementById('variable-js-example').innerHTML = text + day + x + day + text;<br>
                        })<br>
                    </code>
                    <button id="variables">Click to Run!</button>
                    <p id="variable-js-example" style="color: green;"></p>
                    <li>Arrays are also Variables. Just more Complex & have More Data/Values!</li>
                    <li>Arrays Index Values starting at 0</li>
                    <code>
                        const days = new Array()<br>
                        days[0] = "Sunday";<br>
                        days[1] = "Monday";<br>
                        days[2] = "Tuesday";<br>
                        days[3] = "Wednesday";<br>
                        days[4] = "Thursday;<br>
                        days[5] = "Friday";<br>
                        days[6] = "Saturday";<br>
                    </code>
