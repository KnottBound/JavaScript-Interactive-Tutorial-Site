            <h2>What is JavaScript?</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript 'thinks' in terms of "things/objects" in JS they are called Objects.</li>
                    <li>This DOM or Document Object Model is the basic foundation of the entire 
                        JavaScript language. </li>
                    <li>Objects contain objects: a pc has a browser which 
                        has a webpage which has a document.</li>
                    <li>Objects have properties: a webpage (Object) has a background (Object) 
                        color (Property), the color is a property.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript causes Actions to happen on or with Objects: These actions are called Methods.</li>
                    <li>Methods can be referred to as Functions.</li>
                    <li>Functions are Methods that you create/setup to perform a Task.</li>
                    <li>Events: Normally user action like moving mouse/clicking </li>
                    <li>Event Handlers: Actions to take when an Event occurs, which calls JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2 id="event">Events/Event Handlers</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Events are often users visiting/mouse moving/clicks which cause the Event Handler to react.</li>
                    <li>Event Listener: The mechanism for detecting events and triggering a response.</li>
                    <li>Event Handler: The function or code that is executed in response to the event.</li>
                    <li>An example would be a user clicks on a link (Event) and the Event Handler takes you to the specified link.</li>
                    <li>Event Handlers use variables and methods to perform the tasks they've been told to do.</li>
                    <li onMouseOver = "makeGreen()" onMouseOut="makeYellow()">
                        <!--Event: Mouse Movement | Events Listeners: MouseOver & MouseOut | Event Handlers: makeGreen() & makeYellow() -->
                        <a href="#" onMouseOver = "makeGreen()" onMouseOut="makeYellow()">
                            Move Mouse Over To Cause Event. HTML has the Event Listener. JS function is the Event Handler. 
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Event: Mouse Movement | Events Listeners: onMouseOver & onMouseOut | Event Handlers: makeGreen() & makeYellow()</li>
                    <code>
                        // This is the event handler function <br>
                        function handleClick() {<br>
                            console.log('The element was clicked!');<br>
                        }<br>
                        <br>
                        // Adding the event listener to an element<br>
                        document.getElementById('myElement').addEventListener('click', handleClick);
                    </code>
                    <li>Objects can be presented as either methods 'document.getElementById()' or properties 'document.URL' with dots between. </li>
                    <li>Events are not always user dependant, for example the 'onLoad' Event Handler </li>
                    <button id="js-button">Click to Make Orange!</button>
